              Chartered Centre is strategically located 2 kms from Brigade Road,
              towards Koramangala on Hosur Road. It enjoys close proximity to
              the business nerves of the city. The high visibility of the
              location and the road widening (Hosur Road) under progress
              enhances the location value of the project.

              An added advantage would be the 6 km stretch on Hosur Road that
              is going to be a signal-free road from Vellara Junction to Central
              Silk Board.
