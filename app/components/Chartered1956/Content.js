              The project is located at Palace Road - in the heart of Bangalore.
              Palace Road stands for its rich heritage. It is a living tribute
              to the bygone charm of old Royal Bangalore through its ties to
              royal processions and a lasting legacy of Maharajas of Mysore.

              Interestingly, the project proudly stands on a piece of land
              allotted at the instance of the then King of Mysore to the parents
              of the current owners in the year 1956. Hence the project is
              called Chartered 1956 named after the nostalgic year.
